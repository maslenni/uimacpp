This directory contains a C++ version of one of the Java annotations in the
UIMA tutorial. The descriptor file MeetingAnnotatorCPP.xml assumes that the
uimacpp SDK is installed in $UIMA_HOME/uimacpp.

The Java SDK also adds $UIMA_HOME/uimacpp/examples/tutorial/src to the
appropriate native load shared library path so that the C++ annotator will be
found when run using the Java tutorial.
